<h2>User Guide</h2>

<p>Attaching/detaching decompiled source for all classes in a jar is as simple as
clicking the buttons in the toolbar.

<ul>
<li>The buttons in the toolbar look like this:

<p><img src="img/jde_buttons.png">

<p>These buttons are only visible when a class editor is active or a class, jar package
or entire jar is selected in the Package Explorer.

<li>The buttons can be entirely enabled/disabled through the normal Customize
Perspective window:

</ul>

<p>You can also right click on a class within the Package Explorer view to control
decompilation.

<ul>
<li>When decompilation is disabled:

<li>When decompilation is enabled:

<p><img src="img/jde_enabled.png">

<li>You can also right click on a package:

<p><img src="img/jde_package_enabled.png">

<li>Or you can right click on a jar:

<p><img src="img/jde_jar_enabled.png">

<li>Or you can right click on multiple jars or classes across multiple jars:

</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>This project adds the following:

<h3>03/11/2012 (1.1.0)</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mchr3k/jdeclipse-realign/issues/6">Issue 6</a>: Add toolbar buttons 
which allow for decompiled source to be quickly attached/detached.
<li><a href="https://github.com/mchr3k/jdeclipse-realign/issues/8">Issue 8</a>: Make context menu work
when multiple jars have been selected.
</ul>

<h3>28/08/2012 (1.0.9)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Resolve <a href="https://github.com/mchr3k/jdeclipse-realign/issues/5">issue 5</a>. Enable context menu in Project Explorer, allow one click enable decompilation, enable context menu on packages and jars.
</ul>

<h3>08/08/2012 (1.0.8)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Remove JD-Eclipse Realign editor - treat enabling decompiled source like attaching source. This fixes 
issues with jumping to elements within a file. 
</ul>

<h3>01/08/2012 (1.0.7)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add a custom editor icon. 
</ul>

<h3>27/07/2012 (1.0.6)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ensure Eclipse doesn't re-use an existing Class File Viewer.
</ul>

<h3>08/07/2012 (1.0.5)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add "Open Class With" dynamic submenu to choose which editor to open class files with.
<li>Add "Attach Source..." action to "Open Class With" dynamic submenu.
<li>Fix source caching so that after decompiling a class you can still open the normal "Class Viewer" and see attached source.
</ul>

<h3>05/07/2012 (1.0.4)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Alignment for fields and enums in addition to method alignment which was implemented by Alex.
<li>Automated file association setup on first startup. In Eclipse Juno the new "class without source" file type 
is defaulted to JD Eclipse and "class" is defaulted back to the built in class viewer so that real 
source will be displayed.
<li>A single Eclipse update site to download JD-Eclipse along with this project: 
<a href="http://mchr3k-eclipse.appspot.com/">http://mchr3k-eclipse.appspot.com/</a>
</ul>
