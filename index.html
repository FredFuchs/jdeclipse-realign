<h2>Credits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Main JD Eclipse plugin (<a href="http://java.decompiler.free.fr/">http://java.decompiler.free.fr/</a>) by Emmanuel Dupuy
<li>This project is a fork of Realignment for JD-Eclipse (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/realignmentjd/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/realignmentjd/</a>) by Alex Kosinsky
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>This project adds the following:

<ul>
<li>Alignment for fields and enums in addition to method alignment which was implemented by Alex.
<li>Automated file association setup on first startup. In Eclipse Juno the new "class without source" file type 
is defaulted to JD Eclipse and "class" is defaulted back to the built in class viewer so that real 
source will be displayed.
<li>A single Eclipse update site to download JD-Eclipse along with this project: <a href="http://mchr3k-eclipse.appspot.com/">http://mchr3k-eclipse.appspot.com/</a>
</ul>
