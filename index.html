<li>Main JD Eclipse plugin (<a href="http://java.decompiler.free.fr/">http://java.decompiler.free.fr/</a>) by Emmanuel Dupuy
<li>This project is a fork of Realignment for JD-Eclipse (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/realignmentjd/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/realignmentjd/</a>) by Alex Kosinsky

<h2>User Guide</h2>

<p>Viewing the decompiled source for a class is as simple as opening any class in a
jar which doesn't have a source attachment.

<p>Switching between decompiled/regular source for all classes in a jar can be done quickly by
clicking the buttons in the toolbar.

<ul>
<li>The buttons in the toolbar look like this:

<p><img src="img/jde_buttons.png">

<p>These buttons are only visible when a class editor is active or a class, jar package
or entire jar is selected in the Package Explorer or Project Explorer.

<li>The buttons can be entirely enabled/disabled through the normal Customize
Perspective window:

</ul>

<p>You can also right click on a class within the Package Explorer or Project Explorer view to control
decompilation. However, if you choose to open any class in a jar which doesn't have a source attachment, 
decompiled source will be automatically attached to the jar.

<ul>
<li>When decompilation is disabled:

<li>When decompilation is enabled:

<p><img src="img/jde_enabled.png">

<li>You can also right click on a package:

<p><img src="img/jde_package_enabled.png">

<li>Or you can right click on a jar:

<p><img src="img/jde_jar_enabled.png">

<li>Or you can right click on multiple jars or classes across multiple jars:

<p><img src="img/jde_multijar.png">

</ul>

<p>The JD Java Decompiler outputs line numbers in comments. These are used by JD-Eclipse Realign to
line up the decompiled source correctly. Once this process is complete the line number comments can be
optionally stripped out.

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>This project adds the following:

<h3>06/01/2013 (1.1.2)</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mchr3k/jdeclipse-realign/issues/17">Issue 17</a>: Add option to strip line numbers from
decompiled source.
</ul>

<h3>10/11/2012 (1.1.1)</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mchr3k/jdeclipse-realign/issues/12">Issue 12</a>: Restore the JD-Eclipse Realign Class File Viewer
to enable classes without source to automatically have decompiled source attached.
<li>Restored code to automatically set file type associations every time Eclipse is started. This will force the new editor to be 
the default viewer for classes (or for classes without source from Eclipse Juno).
</ul>

<h3>03/11/2012 (1.1.0)</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mchr3k/jdeclipse-realign/issues/6">Issue 6</a>: Add toolbar buttons 
which allow for decompiled source to be quickly attached/detached.
<li><a href="https://github.com/mchr3k/jdeclipse-realign/issues/8">Issue 8</a>: Make context menu work
when multiple jars have been selected.
</ul>

<h3>28/08/2012 (1.0.9)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Resolve <a href="https://github.com/mchr3k/jdeclipse-realign/issues/5">issue 5</a>. Enable context menu in Project Explorer, allow one click enable decompilation, enable context menu on packages and jars.
</ul>

<h3>08/08/2012 (1.0.8)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Remove JD-Eclipse Realign editor - treat enabling decompiled source like attaching source. This fixes 
issues with jumping to elements within a file. 
</ul>

<h3>01/08/2012 (1.0.7)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add a custom editor icon. 
</ul>

<h3>27/07/2012 (1.0.6)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ensure Eclipse doesn't re-use an existing Class File Viewer.
</ul>

<h3>08/07/2012 (1.0.5)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add "Open Class With" dynamic submenu to choose which editor to open class files with.
<li>Add "Attach Source..." action to "Open Class With" dynamic submenu.
<li>Fix source caching so that after decompiling a class you can still open the normal "Class Viewer" and see attached source.
</ul>

<h3>05/07/2012 (1.0.4)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Alignment for fields and enums in addition to method alignment which was implemented by Alex.
<li>Automated file association setup on first startup. In Eclipse Juno the new "class without source" file type 
is defaulted to JD Eclipse and "class" is defaulted back to the built in class viewer so that real 
source will be displayed.
<li>A single Eclipse update site to download JD-Eclipse along with this project: 
<a href="http://mchr3k-eclipse.appspot.com/">http://mchr3k-eclipse.appspot.com/</a>
</ul>
